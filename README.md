# data-sql-project
ðŸŒŸ As part of the Code First Girls Data &amp; SQL Kickstarter, I built an airline database using the coding techniques we learned. Here you'll find the code I submitted for the final project.

During the project we were introduced to:
- SQL programming language
- Database management
- Data analysis and manipulation
- Visualising data

My approach was to initially design the database in Google Sheets, normalising the tables and adding in the Primary and Foreign Keys. I then started inputting the data into SQL and manipulating the data.

The project core requirements included:
âœ” Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
âœ” Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations
between the tables
âœ” Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple
tables in a logical way
âœ” In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to
a query in your DB
âœ” Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how
to extract data from your DB for analysis
âœ” Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

Advanced requirements:
âœ” In your database, create a stored procedure and
demonstrate how it runs
âœ” Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables;
prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to
produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
âœ” Prepare an example query with group by and having to
demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for
analysis
