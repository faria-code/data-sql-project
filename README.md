# data-sql-project
🌟 As part of the Code First Girls Data &amp; SQL Kickstarter, I built an airline database using the coding techniques we learned. Here you'll find the code I submitted for the final project.

During the project we were introduced to:
- SQL programming language
- Database management
- Data analysis and manipulation
- Visualising data

My approach was to initially design the database in Google Sheets, normalising the tables and adding in the Primary and Foreign Keys. I then started inputting the data into SQL and manipulating the data.

The project core requirements included:
- Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
- Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
- Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
- In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
- Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
- Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

Advanced requirements:
- In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
- Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
- Prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
